### [Showcase Video](https://youtu.be/qxih62hg4pQ)

## Overview

The Colour Bridge Lights script is designed to enhance the visual experience in Grand Theft Auto V by adding dynamic lighting effects to certain bridges. Originally conceived as a simple script to create changing color lights on bridges, the project evolved into something more immersive and engaging.

## Features

- **Dynamic Light Effects:** Bridges are adorned with changing color lights to create a visually stunning environment.
- **Police Wanted Level Integration:** When a player is wanted by the police, the bridge lights switch to flashing blue and red to signify police presence.
- **Customizable Light Settings:** Various aspects of the lighting effects, such as color, intensity, and range, can be customized to suit individual preferences.
- **Time-Based Behavior:** The script intelligently adjusts the behavior of the lights based on the in-game time, providing a more realistic experience.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have [ScriptHookV](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/) & [ScriptHookVDotNet](https://github.com/scripthookvdotnet/scripthookvdotnet)
2. Place the `ColourBridgeLights.dll` & `ColourBridgeLights.ini` file into your GTA V *"scripts"* folder.

## How to Use
Experience the enhanced visual effects as you traverse the designated bridges in the game. Watch as the lights change color or flash blue and red based on your actions and the time of day.

## Original Concept
The original idea behind the script was to introduce changing color lights on certain bridges to create a more vibrant and dynamic game world. However, as development progressed, we realized the potential to further immerse players in the game environment by integrating police wanted level mechanics into the lighting effects.

## Future Development
While the current version of the script offers an exciting and immersive experience, there is always room for improvement and expansion. Future updates may include additional features, such as support for more bridges, enhanced visual effects, and further customization options.
